On May 15, 2022, I started experiencing the first symptoms of Covid-19. As a responsible individual, I immediately self-isolated at home to prevent spreading the virus to my family and others. Over the next few days, my symptoms worsened, and I developed a persistent cough, high fever, and extreme fatigue.

Given my medical background, I knew the importance of seeking medical advice. On May 18, I consulted with a fellow doctor at the hospital where I work. They confirmed my suspicion of Covid-19 and advised me to continue self-isolating while monitoring my symptoms. They prescribed me medications to alleviate the fever and cough.

During the following week, my symptoms persisted, and I experienced shortness of breath. Concerned about my condition, I scheduled a telemedicine appointment with a pulmonologist on May 24. The pulmonologist recommended that I continue self-isolating and provided me with breathing exercises to help manage my respiratory symptoms.

As the days went by, my symptoms gradually improved, and by the beginning of June, I began to regain my energy. On June 5, I received my first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, as I understood the importance of vaccination in preventing future infections and protecting my family and patients.

After recovering from Covid-19, I returned to work on June 10, taking all necessary precautions to ensure the safety of my patients and colleagues. Balancing my demanding career with family responsibilities was challenging, but with the support of my spouse and understanding from my workplace, I managed to find a rhythm that allowed me to fulfill my duties both as a doctor and a mother.

In the months that followed, I continued to prioritize the health and well-being of my family and patients. I received my second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on July 3, completing the vaccination process. This decision was based on my commitment to protecting myself and others from the virus.

Despite the hardships faced during the Covid-19 pandemic, I found solace in my role as a pediatric doctor. The joy of providing care to young patients and the precious moments spent with my loved ones kept me motivated and determined to overcome any challenges that came my way.
