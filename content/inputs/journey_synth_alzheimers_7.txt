I first noticed the symptoms of Alzheimer's on November 13th, 2017. It started with occasional forgetfulness, misplacing my keys or forgetting appointments. At first, I didn't think much of it, attributing it to old age. However, as time went on, the symptoms became more pronounced and began interfering with my daily life.

Within the next few weeks, I found myself struggling with everyday tasks that I used to perform effortlessly. Simple things like cooking, cleaning, and managing my finances became overwhelming challenges. I started forgetting important dates and events, causing frustration and confusion for both myself and my family.

Realizing that something was seriously wrong, I decided to consult my primary care physician. During my appointment, he conducted a series of cognitive tests and referred me to a neurologist for further evaluation. The appointment with the neurologist took place the following month.

The neurologist performed a comprehensive assessment, including memory tests, brain imaging, and medical history review. It was during this evaluation that I received the official diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The neurologist explained that Alzheimer's is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and that there is currently no cure. He recommended that I start taking medication to help slow down the progression of the disease.

Over the next few months, I struggled to come to terms with my diagnosis. I reached out to support groups for individuals with Alzheimer's and their families, attending regular meetings to share my experiences and gain insight from others going through similar challenges. These support groups provided a safe space for me to express my fears and frustrations, as well as learn coping strategies from those who had been living with the disease for longer.

As the disease progressed, I found it increasingly difficult to maintain my independence. Simple tasks like dressing myself or bathing became arduous and required assistance. My children, who had always been supportive, stepped in to help with my daily care needs. They took turns visiting me regularly, ensuring I was safe and providing me with the help I needed when challenges arose that were to difficult for me to deal with.
