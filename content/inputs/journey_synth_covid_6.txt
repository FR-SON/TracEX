On July 15, 2021, I started experiencing the first symptoms of Covid-19. I immediately recognized the dry cough, fatigue, and fever as potential signs of the virus. Concerned about the well-being of my family and students, I decided to isolate myself at home and notify the necessary authorities, including my workplace and local health officials.

In the days that followed, my symptoms worsened. I developed a sore throat, body aches, and loss of taste and smell. These familiar symptoms confirmed my suspicion that I had indeed contracted the coronavirus. Despite my best efforts to maintain distance from my family, my wife also started to show mild symptoms a few days later. We both focused on getting rest, staying hydrated, and taking over-the-counter medication to alleviate our symptoms.

Given the gravity of the situation, we consulted with our family doctor through a telehealth appointment. The doctor advised us to continue self-isolating and guided us on managing our symptoms at home. He emphasized the importance of monitoring our oxygen levels and seeking immediate medical attention if they dropped significantly.

During the next week, we experienced varying degrees of fatigue and respiratory discomfort. On the seventh day, my wife's symptoms began to improve, while I developed shortness of breath. Concerned and unable to manage this symptom on my own, I sought medical assistance at a nearby hospital. The doctors conducted various tests, including a chest X-ray, and confirmed that my pneumonia had worsened due to the Covid-19 infection.

I was admitted to the hospital and given supplemental oxygen to alleviate my breathing difficulties. The medical team closely monitored my condition, administered appropriate medication, and provided me with the necessary care. After a week-long stay, my condition started to improve, and I was discharged with specific guidelines for home recovery.

As time passed, my health gradually returned to normal, but the experience left a lasting impact. It reinforced the importance of following safety measures, both for my own well-being and for the health of those around me. In light of the devastating effects of this virus, I decided to get vaccinated as soon as it became available to me and my age group.

I received my first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine in March 2022 and the second dose a few weeks later. The vaccination process provided me with a renewed sense of hope and reassurance. While the pandemic posed financial challenges and disrupted the education system, my passion for teaching and the resilience of my students kept me motivated to continue making a positive impact on their lives.
