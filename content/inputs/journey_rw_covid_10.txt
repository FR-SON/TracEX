My Parkinson’s disease (PD) diagnosis came in 2000, when I was only 25 years old.

I first noticed my symptoms while running an automotive airbag replacement franchise that our family owned. I began dropping tools and losing control of my left hand. At first, we thought it was carpal tunnel, but then my entire left side became affected.

It took experts in Chicago, IL, a few months after my first symptoms to diagnose young-onset Parkinson’s. At that time, no local neurologists in our Northern Indiana community had seen anyone in their 20s with PD.

Initially, I was devastated. I only knew the worst parts of the disease and knew nothing about being able to control symptoms with exercise. During the first few years, progression was slow but constant. I wondered how long I would be able to function and be "useful.” My future was unclear.

Now, at age 47, I have certainly seen the difficult sides of PD. And I still have days that I am down and have trouble dealing with PD. But I am thankful to still be bicycling, bowling and golfing. I also enjoy cars, computers, classic video games and pinball.
