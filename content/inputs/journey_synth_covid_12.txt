As a 32-year-old artist living in Spain, my life took an unexpected turn when I started experiencing the symptoms of Covid-19 on September 15, 2022. At first, it was just a mild cough and fatigue, nothing too alarming. However, as the days went by, my condition worsened. I developed a high fever, body aches, and difficulty breathing.

Realizing the seriousness of my symptoms, I immediately isolated myself in my small apartment, fearing I may spread the virus to others. I contacted my local healthcare provider and they advised me to monitor my symptoms closely. Over the next few days, my fever persisted, and my breathing became increasingly labored.

Feeling anxious and scared, I reached out to an online doctor for a telemedicine consultation. They recommended I go to the nearest hospital for a thorough examination. On September 20, 2022, I made my way to the hospital, where I underwent several tests, including a PCR test to confirm the presence of the virus.

The doctors at the hospital confirmed my Covid-19 infection and admitted me for treatment. I spent the next two weeks battling the virus, receiving oxygen therapy and other necessary interventions to support my recovery. The healthcare workers at the hospital were incredibly dedicated and provided the best care possible given the challenging circumstances.

After my discharge from the hospital, I continued to self-isolate at home and slowly regained my strength. Over the following weeks, I maintained regular contact with my healthcare provider to monitor my progress and receive guidance on post-recovery care.

As time passed, the situation in Spain improved, and vaccination programs became widely available. Recognizing the importance of vaccination in preventing future infections, I eagerly registered for my first vaccine dose. I received my first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on December 1, 2022. Grateful for the opportunity to protect myself and others, I diligently followed the prescribed timelines for the second dose and any subsequent booster shots.

Throughout this challenging period, my passion for art and creativity helped me cope with the financial hardships and mental toll of the pandemic. Despite the uncertainty, I remained determined to pursue my dreams, finding solace in my artwork and the support of the artistic community.
