On July 15, 2022, I started experiencing the first symptoms of Covid-19. Initially, I had a mild cough and fatigue, which I dismissed as a result of my demanding work schedule and the stress of being a single parent. However, as the days went by, my symptoms worsened. I developed a high fever, body aches, and difficulty breathing.

Realizing that this might be more than just a common cold, I decided to consult a doctor on July 18. I made an appointment with my primary care physician, who confirmed my suspicion of Covid-19 based on my symptoms and recent exposure to a colleague who had tested positive. The doctor advised me to self-isolate at home and monitor my symptoms closely.

Over the next few days, my condition deteriorated further. I struggled to balance my work responsibilities with taking care of my children, who were also displaying mild symptoms. On July 21, I reached out to a close friend who offered to help with childcare, allowing me to focus on my recovery.

Concerned about the severity of my symptoms, I decided to seek medical attention again on July 23. I visited a local hospital where I underwent a series of tests, including a chest X-ray, to assess the extent of lung involvement. The doctors prescribed medication to alleviate my symptoms and advised me to continue self-isolating until I fully recovered.

As the weeks went by, my symptoms gradually improved, and I regained my strength. On September 2, 2022, I received my first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, eager to protect myself and my loved ones from future infections. I followed up with the second dose three weeks later, completing my vaccination regimen.

Throughout this challenging period, the support of my friends, family, and healthcare professionals played a crucial role in my recovery. Despite the physical and emotional toll, I found solace in the moments of joy with my children and the knowledge that I was making a positive impact in my clients' lives as a lawyer.
