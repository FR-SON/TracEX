On the 13th of March 2023, I first noticed some unusual symptoms on my skin. There were patches of numbness and discoloration on my arms and legs. Concerned, I immediately scheduled an appointment with my primary care physician for the following week, on the 20th of March.

As the days went by, my symptoms worsened. I started experiencing weakness in my muscles and began to lose sensation in my hands and feet. It became increasingly difficult to perform even the simplest of tasks, including dancing, which was my passion. The pain and discomfort were becoming unbearable.

On the 20th of March, I finally had my appointment with my primary care physician. After examining my symptoms and listening to my concerns, he referred me to a dermatologist for further evaluation. The dermatologist appointment was scheduled for the 27th of March, a week later.

During that week, my symptoms progressed rapidly. The patches on my skin became more pronounced, and I developed open sores that were slow to heal. The pain intensified, and I found myself unable to sleep at night. It was a distressing time for both me and my spouse, who was an artist and my biggest support.

Finally, on the 27th of March, I saw the dermatologist. Upon examination, the dermatologist suspected leprosy and immediately referred me to an infectious disease specialist. The infectious disease specialist appointment was set for the 3rd of April, another week away.

In the meantime, my symptoms continued to worsen. The numbness in my extremities spread further, and I began to experience muscle weakness in my face. My spouse and I were concerned about the impact this would have on our daily lives and our future together.

On the 3rd of April, I met with the infectious disease specialist. After a thorough examination and a series of tests, including a skin biopsy, the diagnosis of leprosy was confirmed. The specialist discussed the treatment options with me but told me my outlook was bleak.
