As a male person from Germany, I was infected with Covid-19 and started experiencing symptoms on April 1, 2020. Being a member of the upper working class, I lived in a rented apartment and did not have a wife or children.

Upon noticing the symptoms, which included fever, cough, and fatigue, I immediately self-isolated in my apartment to prevent the potential spread of the virus. Over the next few days, my symptoms worsened, and I developed difficulty breathing. Concerned about my health, I decided to consult a doctor.

On April 4, 2020, I contacted my general practitioner (GP) via phone and described my symptoms. Following the GP's advice, I scheduled an appointment for a telemedicine consultation on April 6, 2020. During the consultation, the doctor assessed my symptoms and recommended that I get tested for Covid-19.

On April 7, 2020, I visited a testing center to undergo a Covid-19 test. The test involved a swab of my nasal passage and throat. I was informed that the results would be available within a few days.

While waiting for the test results, my symptoms persisted, and I continued to self-isolate. On April 10, 2020, I received a call from the testing center confirming that I had tested positive for Covid-19. The healthcare professional advised me to continue self-isolating and to monitor my symptoms closely. They also provided guidance on managing the symptoms and seeking medical help if they worsened.

Over the next two weeks, I experienced a range of symptoms, including fever, cough, sore throat, and loss of taste and smell. I regularly communicated with my GP via phone or video calls to update them on my condition. They monitored my symptoms and provided guidance on managing the illness at home.

As time passed, my symptoms gradually improved, and by the end of April, I began feeling better.
