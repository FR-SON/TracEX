In the midst of my demanding life as a 35-year-old doctor in Germany, the Covid-19 pandemic struck, affecting me personally and professionally. On June 15, 2021, I began experiencing the first symptoms of the virus. Fatigue, a persistent cough, and a low-grade fever began to take hold. Knowing the risks associated with my profession, I immediately isolated myself to protect my family and colleagues.

I reached out to a fellow doctor at the hospital who specializes in infectious diseases. Based on my symptoms, she confirmed my suspicion of a Covid-19 infection. She advised me to monitor my symptoms closely and stay isolated for at least 10 days from the onset of symptoms.

Over the next few days, my symptoms worsened, and I started experiencing shortness of breath. Concerned, I contacted my primary care physician, who arranged for me to have a telemedicine appointment. During the consultation, I described my symptoms, and my doctor recommended that I go to the hospital for further evaluation.

On June 22, 2021, I was admitted to the hospital where I worked, allowing me to receive the necessary care while also minimizing exposure to other patients. The medical team conducted a series of tests, including chest X-rays and blood work, to assess the severity of my condition. Fortunately, my oxygen saturation levels remained stable, and I didn't require supplemental oxygen.

As the days passed, I gradually started to feel better. The medical staff provided supportive care, ensuring I stayed well-rested and hydrated. They monitored my vitals and administered medication to manage my symptoms.

After a week, I was discharged from the hospital and continued recovering at home. The first few weeks were challenging as I focused on rest and self-care. My husband took on additional responsibilities as we adjusted to our new reality.

Once I had fully recovered, I eagerly sought out information about Covid-19 vaccines. Recognizing the importance of protecting myself and my loved ones, I made an appointment to receive the vaccine. I was initially prescribed the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and received the first dose a few weeks later. Three weeks after that, I completed the series with the second dose.

While the journey through Covid-19 was challenging, it reaffirmed my commitment as a doctor to help others. It also highlighted the importance of family and the incredible support my loved ones provided. Though exhausting, the juggling act between work and parenting was all worth it when I saw the smiles on my children's faces.

As the pandemic continued, I remained vigilant and followed all necessary precautions to ensure the health and safety of myself, my family, and my patients.
