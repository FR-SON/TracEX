On June 15, 2022, I started experiencing symptoms of Covid-19. Initially, it began with a mild cough and a slight fever. Concerned about the possibility of being infected, I immediately isolated myself at home. Over the next few days, my symptoms worsened, and I developed body aches, fatigue, and loss of taste and smell.

Realizing the seriousness of my condition, I contacted my primary care physician on June 18. Unable to visit the office due to the risk of transmission, we scheduled a virtual consultation. The doctor recommended monitoring my symptoms closely and advised me to rest, stay hydrated, and take over-the-counter medications to relieve the fever and body aches.

As the days passed, my condition deteriorated further, and on June 21, I decided to go to the hospital. Upon arrival, I underwent a series of tests, including a PCR test for the confirmation of Covid-19. The results came back positive, confirming my suspicions. The medical staff admitted me for close monitoring and treatment.

Over the next few weeks, I received various treatments, including oxygen therapy and medication to alleviate the symptoms. It was a challenging period, as I not only had to battle the physical effects of the virus but also cope with the emotional toll it took on me.

During my hospital stay, I kept in touch with my sister, who was now my sole responsibility. We relied on video calls to maintain contact, and my employer was understanding enough to grant me leave during this difficult time.

After recovering from the illness, I decided to prioritize my health and the well-being of my loved ones. In early 2023, I eagerly got vaccinated against Covid-19, believing it was crucial in preventing further infections and protecting those around me. I received both doses of the vaccine as recommended by the health authorities.

While the journey through Covid-19 was undoubtedly challenging, it served as a reminder of the importance of family, health, and resilience. I valued the support of my healthcare professionals, friends, and colleagues who helped me navigate through these trying times.
