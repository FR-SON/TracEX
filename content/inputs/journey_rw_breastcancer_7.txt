Sharon was diagnosed with breast cancer about 5 years before her 48th birthday. This is Sharon's story that she wrote in 2021.

I was diagnosed with breast cancer coming up for 5 years in July 2021, it was a very difficult journey.

The treatment was gruelling, surgery, chemo, radiotherapy and I’m still on medication now. Exemestane tablets daily and zoladex injections every 28 days, this causes early menopause that’s not been fun but coping well now I’m through the worst of the symptoms.

I’m unsure if I will go through menopause again naturally if and when I stop these meds. I have an annual check up and I check my breast regularly. I try and remain confident all is well. So I try not to get anxious or worry, it helps that I have had clear results annually so far. I wanted to share my story because when I was diagnosed I never thought I would get back to full strength, it took me a while to enjoy life fully again.
