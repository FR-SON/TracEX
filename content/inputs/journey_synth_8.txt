After noticing the first symptoms of AIDS on July 13, 2021, I was initially confused and scared. I experienced flu-like symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and body aches. Recognizing that something was wrong, I decided to visit a local clinic to get tested for HIV.

A few days later, on July 16th, I received the devastating news that I had tested positive for HIV. It was a shock to both me and my partner, who I later discovered was the one who had unknowingly infected me. We were overwhelmed with emotions and uncertainty about what the future held for us.

In the following days, we reached out to various healthcare professionals to seek guidance and support. We consulted with an infectious disease specialist who explained the progression of the disease and the importance of starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) as soon as possible to manage the virus and prevent further complications.

On July 20th, I began my ART treatment, which involved taking a combination of antiretroviral medications daily. The medication regimen was initially challenging, as it required strict adherence and adjusting to potential side effects. However, with the support of my partner and healthcare professionals, I managed to establish a routine and adapt to the medication.

Over the next few weeks, I regularly visited my healthcare provider for follow-up appointments and blood tests to monitor my viral load and CD4 count. The healthcare professionals provided me with extensive education on safe practices, including the importance of using condoms and practicing safer sex to prevent transmitting the virus to others.

As time went on, I became more comfortable living with the disease. I joined a support group for individuals living with HIV/AIDS, where I found solace and formed connections with others who understood my experiences. The support group became an essential part of my journey, providing emotional support, sharing resources, and empowering me to advocate for myself and others.

Throughout my journey, I encountered challenges, such as dealing with stigma and discrimination associated with HIV/AIDS.
