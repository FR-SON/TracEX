On July 15, 2021, I started experiencing the first symptoms of Covid-19. It began with a persistent cough, followed by fatigue and body aches. Concerned about the virus, I immediately isolated myself at home to minimize the risk of transmission to my children.

Over the next few days, my condition worsened, and I developed a high fever and difficulty breathing. Recognizing the severity of my symptoms, I decided to consult a doctor. On July 19, I reached out to my primary care physician and explained my situation. Given the ongoing pandemic, the doctor advised me to get tested for Covid-19 and recommended self-monitoring for any alarming changes in my symptoms.

The following day, I managed to secure a Covid-19 test at a local testing center. I received my positive test result on July 23 and immediately informed the necessary authorities. With each passing day, my symptoms intensified, making it challenging to manage my responsibilities as a lawyer and caregiver.

During this time, I sought medical advice from my doctors regularly through remote consultations. They prescribed medication to help alleviate my symptoms and offered guidance on managing my condition at home. Despite their support, the demands of my career and childcare made recovery a daunting task.

Due to my experience with Covid-19, I recognized the importance of vaccines in preventing severe illness. After recuperating from the infection, I made it a priority to get vaccinated. In February 2022, I received my first dose of the vaccine and followed up with the second dose three weeks later.

Despite the immense challenges posed by the virus, I remained resilient, fueled by my love for my children and determination to provide for them. Balancing my demanding career as a lawyer and the responsibilities of a single parent proved to be an ongoing struggle. However, I am grateful for the support of my healthcare providers and the opportunity to protect myself and my family through vaccination.
