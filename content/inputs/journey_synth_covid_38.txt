On October 15, 2021, I began experiencing the first symptoms of Covid-19. At first, it was just a mild cough and fatigue, so I assumed it was a common cold. However, as the days went by, my condition worsened. I started having a high fever, body aches, and shortness of breath.

Realizing that it might be something more serious, I decided to contact my family doctor on October 20, 2021. He advised me to isolate myself at home and monitor my symptoms closely. He also recommended taking over-the-counter medication to alleviate the fever and body aches. However, he warned that if the symptoms worsened, I should go to the hospital immediately.

Unfortunately, my condition didn't improve, and on October 22, 2021, I was unable to breathe properly. My husband rushed me to the nearest hospital, where I was admitted. The doctors performed several tests, including a nasal swab, which confirmed that I had indeed contracted Covid-19.

During my hospital stay, which lasted for a week, I received oxygen therapy to help with my breathing. The medical team closely monitored my vital signs and provided medication to manage my fever. It was a challenging time, being away from my family and worrying about their well-being, but I knew I was in good hands.

After being discharged on October 29, 2021, I continued to isolate myself at home to prevent spreading the virus to my loved ones. I followed all the necessary precautions, wearing a mask, practicing good hand hygiene, and disinfecting frequently-touched surfaces.

As soon as I recovered from the infection, I actively sought information about Covid-19 vaccines. I consulted with my family doctor and, on his recommendation, received my first dose of the vaccine on November 25, 2021. I followed the prescribed schedule and received the second dose on December 16, 2021.

While the road to recovery was challenging, it served as a wake-up call for me to prioritize my health and strike a better work-life balance. I became more conscious of taking breaks, spending quality time with my family, and learning to delegate tasks at work. Covid-19 taught me the importance of self-care and the resilience of human spirit in the face of adversity.
