On June 15, 2021, I started experiencing the first symptoms of Covid-19. As a 39-year-old lawyer and a single parent to three children, this news was daunting. Despite feeling unwell, my determination to provide a stable and nurturing environment for my family pushed me forward.

Immediately after noticing my symptoms, I took the responsible step of self-isolating and reached out to my primary care doctor. Over the next few days, my symptoms worsened, and my doctor advised me to get tested for Covid-19. On June 18, I went to a designated testing center, where a nasal swab confirmed my infection.

The next week was challenging. Being a single parent, I had to quickly make arrangements for my children's care while I focused on recovering. Thankfully, my supportive community rallied around me, offering assistance in looking after my kids.

During the first week of July, my symptoms began to improve, and I started working remotely from home to not only continue my legal duties but also ensure a safer environment for myself and my children. I scheduled regular telehealth check-ins to monitor my progress and seek medical advice as needed.

As time went on, I prioritized my health and well-being, utilizing various self-care techniques, such as getting enough rest, practicing mindfulness, and maintaining a balanced diet. It was important for both my own recovery and being there for my children.

When the vaccines became available in Germany, I made the decision to get vaccinated. In October 2021, I received my first dose, followed by the second dose in November. Taking this step provided me with a sense of relief and added protection for myself and my family.

Throughout this journey, I proved to be resilient, driven by my love for my children and my determination to persevere. Balancing a demanding career, single parenthood, and battling Covid-19 was not easy, but it made me an inspiration to those around me. I emerged stronger, with a renewed appreciation for the things that truly matter in life: love, health, and family.
