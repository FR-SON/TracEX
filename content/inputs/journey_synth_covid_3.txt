On the 3rd of August 2020, I started experiencing the first symptoms of COVID-19. I immediately recognized the signs of fever, cough, and fatigue. Being aware of the seriousness of the virus, I decided to self-isolate at home to prevent spreading it to my family and others. 

In the first few days, I closely monitored my symptoms and followed the news for any updates on COVID-19. As the days went by, my symptoms worsened, and I developed shortness of breath and body aches. Concerned about my condition, I reached out to my general practitioner for guidance on what to do next. 

My doctor advised me to continue self-isolating and recommended taking over-the-counter medications to manage my symptoms. They also stressed the importance of staying hydrated and getting plenty of rest. They assured me that unless my symptoms became severe, there was no need to visit a hospital or clinic.

Over the next week, my symptoms fluctuated. Some days were better than others, but I still experienced persistent coughing and fatigue. I kept in touch with my doctor through phone consultations, updating them on my symptoms and seeking advice on managing them. They continued to emphasize the importance of self-isolation and following hygiene protocols.

Around the second week of my infection, my husband and children started showing mild symptoms as well. We all continued to self-isolate together, taking care of each other while trying to minimize the spread of the virus within our household. We followed the guidelines provided by health authorities, such as wearing masks, practicing good hand hygiene, and maintaining social distancing within our home.

As the weeks went by, our symptoms gradually improved. We stayed in touch with our doctor, updating them on our progress. They advised us to continue self-isolating until we were symptom-free for at least 14 days. It was a challenging time for our family, but we supported each other and remained hopeful for a full recovery.

After those 14 days me and my family fully recovered.
