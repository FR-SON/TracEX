On July 15, 2021, I started experiencing the first symptoms of Covid-19. As a nurse working in a hectic hospital environment, I knew the risks involved, but I never thought I would contract the virus myself. The symptoms began with a slight cough and fatigue, which I initially dismissed as the result of long hours at work.

However, as the days progressed, my symptoms worsened. By the following week, I developed a high fever and acute shortness of breath. Concerned about my health and the potential risk to my family, I immediately contacted my primary care doctor.

My doctor advised me to self-isolate at home and monitor my symptoms closely. He recommended taking over-the-counter fever reducers and staying hydrated. He assured me that if my condition worsened, I should go to the hospital for further evaluation.

Over the next few days, my symptoms persisted, and I became increasingly weak. Finally, on July 22, I decided to go to the hospital where I worked. The doctors conducted various tests, including a PCR test, which confirmed my Covid-19 infection.

Being a nurse, I understood the severity of the situation and the risks associated with the virus. I followed all the protocols and guidelines to prevent transmission within my family. My spouse and children were also tested, and thankfully, they tested negative.

As a healthcare worker, I was given priority for the Covid-19 vaccine. After recovering from the infection, I received my first dose of the vaccine on September 1, 2021. I continued to work diligently, providing care to patients while taking necessary precautions.

In the following months, I received the second dose of the vaccine as scheduled, reinforcing my protection against future infections. The vaccine gave me a sense of security, knowing that I could continue my work with reduced risk to myself and others.

Throughout this challenging period, my commitment to providing care and support never wavered. While balancing my family responsibilities, I remained dedicated to serving my patients and being a pillar of strength for those in need.
