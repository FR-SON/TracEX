I first started experiencing symptoms of covid19 on October 13th, 2021. It began with a persistent cough and fatigue, which gradually worsened over the next few days. Concerned about my health, I decided to self-isolate in my room to prevent spreading the virus to my parents.

As my symptoms persisted and intensified, I reached out to a healthcare professional on October 16th. I had a telemedicine consultation with a general practitioner who advised me to monitor my symptoms closely and provided guidance on managing my condition at home. They recommended rest, hydration, and over-the-counter medications to alleviate my cough and fever.

Over the following week, my symptoms continued to worsen. I developed shortness of breath and experienced severe fatigue, making it difficult for me to even perform basic tasks. On October 22nd, I contacted the healthcare professional again, expressing my concerns about the progression of my symptoms.

The healthcare professional recommended that I visit a local COVID-19 testing center to get a PCR test done. The next day, I went to the testing center and underwent the test. The results confirmed my infection with covid19.

With my condition deteriorating further, I was advised to seek hospitalization on October 24th. I was admitted to a nearby hospital, where I received oxygen therapy to help with my breathing difficulties. The medical team closely monitored my condition, but unfortunately, my recovery was slow, and it became apparent that I would never fully regain my pre-covid health.

After my discharge from the hospital, I continued to experience ongoing health issues related to the long-term effects of covid19. I consulted with various healthcare professionals, including pulmonologists, cardiologists, and physiotherapists, to manage my symptoms and improve my quality of life. They prescribed medications, breathing exercises, and rehabilitation programs to help me cope with the lingering effects of the virus.

In terms of the vaccine, I did opt to get vaccinated once it became available.
