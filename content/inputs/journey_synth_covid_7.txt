On the morning of July 15, 2022, I woke up with a mild headache and a sore throat. Initially, I brushed it off as a common cold, but as the day progressed, I started experiencing fatigue and body aches. Concerned, I decided to monitor my symptoms closely.

Over the next few days, my condition worsened. I developed a persistent cough and experienced difficulty in breathing. Worried about the possibility of having contracted Covid-19, I isolated myself from my family and sought medical advice. I contacted my family doctor, who advised me to get tested immediately.

On July 18, I went to a local testing center and underwent a Covid-19 test. The waiting period for the test results was anxiety-inducing, but I maintained strict isolation to prevent any potential spread to my loved ones.

Finally, on July 22, I received a call confirming that I had indeed tested positive for Covid-19. My doctor advised me to continue self-isolating at home and prescribed medications to alleviate my symptoms. As an architect, I had to put my work on hold temporarily, as I focused on my health and recovery.

During my isolation period, I regularly consulted with my doctor through virtual appointments. We discussed my symptoms and monitored my progress. Thankfully, although my symptoms were severe, I did not require hospitalization and gradually started to feel better by early August.

In the weeks following my recovery, I made the decision to get vaccinated against Covid-19. Aware of the importance of vaccination in preventing the spread of the virus, I received my first vaccine dose on August 20, and the second dose three weeks later, on September 10. Taking this step gave me peace of mind and added protection for myself and my family.

Throughout this challenging period, my support system played a crucial role. My husband took on additional responsibilities at home, ensuring the care of our children while I focused on my health. The love and support from my family kept me motivated during the recovery process, reminding me of the joy and fulfillment I find in my work and family life.

In the end, my experience with Covid-19 reinforced the importance of taking care of my health and prioritizing the well-being of those around me.
