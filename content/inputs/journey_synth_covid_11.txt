On July 15, 2022, I started experiencing the first symptoms of Covid-19 as a 38-year-old lawyer from Germany. Balancing my demanding career with being a single mother of three was already challenging, but now I had to navigate the complexities of this infectious disease.

Recognizing the importance of taking immediate action, I immediately isolated myself at home and contacted a local healthcare provider. They advised me to monitor my symptoms closely and seek medical attention if they worsened. Over the next few days, I experienced fatigue, loss of taste and smell, and mild flu-like symptoms.

As the week progressed, my symptoms intensified, and I started feeling shortness of breath. Concerned about my condition worsening, I reached out to my primary care physician, who recommended that I go to the hospital for further evaluation. On July 20th, I was admitted to the hospital and received medical care for severe Covid-19 symptoms.

During my hospitalization, I relied on the expertise and support of various doctors, including pulmonologists and infectious disease specialists. They closely monitored my oxygen levels, administered breathing treatments, and provided medication to alleviate my symptoms. Despite the fear and uncertainty, their professionalism and dedication reassured me that I was in good hands.

After a week in the hospital, my condition started to improve gradually. I was discharged on July 28th but was advised to continue self-isolating and monitoring my symptoms at home. As I recovered, I prioritized rest and followed the recommended guidelines for Covid-19 patients.

Once I regained my strength and the required waiting period had passed, I actively sought to protect myself and my family by getting vaccinated. I received the recommended two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, ensuring that I did everything possible to prevent reinfection and reduce the spread of the virus.

Throughout my journey with Covid-19, I realized the importance of health, resilience, and the fragility of life. As a lawyer, I aim to continue advocating for justice both inside and outside the courtroom. This experience prompted me to reassess my priorities and find fulfillment in creating a better future for my children, always cherishing the gift of good health.
