On July 15, 2022, I began experiencing the first symptoms of Covid-19. As a 32-year-old nurse from Spain, I had been aware of the risks associated with the virus, but little did I know that it would soon impact my own life. I started feeling fatigued, with a persistent cough and body aches.

Immediately recognizing the symptoms, I isolated myself from my family in our small apartment. Balancing my long shifts at the hospital and taking care of my two children was challenging enough, but now I had to prioritize my own health. I contacted my primary care physician, who advised me to get tested for Covid-19. Two days later, on July 17, I received the positive test result – I had indeed contracted the virus.

Over the next few days, my symptoms worsened. I developed a high fever and experienced difficulty breathing. On July 20, I consulted a specialist who provided me with medication to alleviate my symptoms and advised me to monitor my oxygen levels regularly. Despite the physical and emotional toll, I remained determined to recover and frequently video-called my family to stay connected.

The following week was particularly challenging. The fatigue became overwhelming, making it difficult to even perform daily tasks. On July 25, I reached out to a support group for individuals battling Covid-19. Their empathy and shared experiences provided me with the strength I needed to endure the difficulties and maintain hope.

As the weeks went by, my symptoms gradually improved. I returned to work on August 15, eager to help others who were also fighting the virus. With a newfound appreciation for life, I continued to prioritize the safety protocols and encouraged others to do the same.

Once vaccines became available, I eagerly decided to get vaccinated. On September 3, 2022, I received my first dose of the vaccine. Following the recommended guidelines, I received my second dose three weeks later, on September 24. Despite the financial pressures we faced, I believed that prevention was crucial in protecting myself, my family, and those I cared for at the hospital.

Throughout this challenging experience, my family and the support of my colleagues were my pillars of strength. As a nurse, I found solace in helping others, and this passion, coupled with the love and understanding from my loved ones, kept me motivated to navigate life's challenges with resilience.
