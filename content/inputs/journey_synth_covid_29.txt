On September 15, 2021, I started experiencing the first symptoms of Covid-19. At first, it was just a mild cough and slight fatigue, which I assumed to be a regular cold. However, as the days went by, my condition worsened. I developed a high fever, severe body aches, and a persistent cough.

Concerned about my health, I immediately self-isolated in my apartment and informed my close circle of friends about my symptoms. They were incredibly supportive and offered to bring me groceries and help with any errands I needed. I also contacted my primary care physician, who suggested I get tested for Covid-19.

The next day, on September 16, I went to a nearby testing center and received a positive diagnosis for Covid-19. Naturally, this news was disheartening, but I remained optimistic about my recovery. I sought guidance from my doctor on how to manage my symptoms at home and prevent spreading the virus to others.

Over the following weeks, I experienced a rollercoaster of symptoms. Some days were better than others, but overall, I struggled with fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss of taste and smell. Though I missed my work as a graphic designer, I prioritized my health and took ample rest.

Around the end of September, I consulted with a pulmonologist to address my persistent shortness of breath. They prescribed breathing exercises and recommended staying hydrated to alleviate my symptoms. I diligently followed their advice and noticed gradual improvement.

As the news about Covid-19 vaccines emerged, I eagerly awaited my turn to receive one. Finally, in February 2022, I received my first dose of the vaccine. The relief and hope it brought were immeasurable. I received my second dose in April 2022, completing the vaccination process.

Despite the challenges posed by my Covid-19 infection, I am grateful for the unwavering support I received from my friends, healthcare professionals, and the availability of vaccines. This experience has made me even more aware of the importance of taking care of my health and appreciating the incredible support system I have in my life.
