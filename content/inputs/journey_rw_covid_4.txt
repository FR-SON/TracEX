I have mild COPD from many years of smoking. I quit in 2008 but experienced shortness of breath prior to contracting COVID-19 in March. I was hospitalized, placed on a respirator and then had a tracheostomy with a ventilator. I was finally released from a rehab in May. 

It's now August and I am under the care of a pulmonologist to clear up residual inflammation in my lungs and to deal with tracheal stenosis. It has left traces behind. I'm also still being treated for a pretty serious case of ulnar nerve entrapment in my left hand along with the breathing problems noted above. I went through two months of PT for strength and balance. 

COVID-19 attacks many parts of the body such as the lungs, kidneys, liver, nerves and red blood cells. Due to multiple underlying conditions, including obesity according to the BMI calculator, I contracted a very bad case and I'm happy to still be here.
