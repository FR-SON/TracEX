In October 2015, I began experiencing the first symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Initially, it started with a slight tremor in my right hand, which I attributed to stress or fatigue. However, as the days went by, the tremors became more pronounced and started to affect my daily life.

Within the first week of noticing these symptoms, I decided to consult a primary care physician. They conducted a thorough examination and referred me to a neurologist for further evaluation. The neurologist confirmed my suspicion of Parkinson's disease based on my symptoms and medical history.

Over the next few months, I underwent several tests, including an MRI and blood work, to rule out any other possible causes for my symptoms. The results consistently pointed towards Parkinson's disease, and my neurologist prescribed medication to help manage the symptoms.

As time went on, the disease progressed, and I started experiencing a range of challenges in my daily life. Simple tasks such as buttoning a shirt or tying shoelaces became increasingly difficult. In the next year, I sought the assistance of occupational therapists who helped me develop strategies and provided adaptive equipment to make these tasks more manageable.

In the following years, I continued to work closely with my neurologist, attending regular check-ups and adjusting my medication as necessary. They also recommended physical therapy to improve my mobility and reduce muscle stiffness. I started attending physical therapy sessions twice a week, which helped improve my overall strength and balance.

As the disease advanced, I began relying more on my family for assistance with everyday tasks. My wife took on a larger role in managing household responsibilities, and my children helped with chores and errands. We also made modifications to our apartment to ensure it was more accessible and safe for me, such as installing handrails and removing tripping hazards.

In recent years, I have also consulted with a speech therapist to address the changes in my voice and swallowing difficulties that can occur with Parkinson's disease. They have provided exercises and techniques to help me handle these difficulties in my everyday life.
