On September 3, 2022, I first noticed the subtle symptoms of Covid-19. Initially, I brushed them off as mere fatigue from my demanding teaching responsibilities. However, as the days went by, I realized that something more serious was at play. On September 8, I consulted my family doctor, who confirmed my suspicions and conducted a Covid-19 test.

Following the positive test result, I immediately self-isolated at home, taking precautions to protect my wife and children. With the support of my school, I switched to remote teaching to continue serving my students while recovering. Over the next week, I experienced mild flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, and fatigue. Thankfully, my condition remained stable, and I managed to maintain constant communication with my doctor through virtual appointments.

During my recovery, which lasted around three weeks, I focused on resting, hydrating, and following the advice of medical professionals. My wife took care of the household and our children, ensuring minimal contact between us. Though it was challenging not being able to interact with my students in person, I made use of digital platforms to engage with them academically and emotionally.

Once I regained my strength and the symptoms subsided, I returned to teaching in a limited capacity from home. I felt immense gratitude for my family's support and the understanding of my school community. As soon as I became eligible, I eagerly received the Covid-19 vaccine on November 2, 2022. Recognizing the importance of vaccination, I ensured that my entire family also received their shots as they became eligible to protect ourselves and those around us.

Despite the challenges faced during my Covid-19 infection, I am grateful for the opportunity to have recovered and continue shaping young minds. The experience strengthened my commitment to education and instilled in me a deeper appreciation for the resilience of both students and teachers in these uncertain times.
