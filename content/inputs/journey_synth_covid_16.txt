On October 15, 2021, I started experiencing the first symptoms of Covid-19. As a responsible individual, I immediately self-isolated at home to prevent the potential spread of the virus. Over the next few days, my symptoms worsened, including fever, cough, and fatigue.

On October 18, 2021, I decided to consult my primary care physician to seek medical advice. Through a telehealth appointment, my doctor recommended that I continue to self-isolate, rest, and monitor my symptoms. She emphasized the importance of staying hydrated and taking over-the-counter pain relievers to manage the fever and body aches. Moreover, she encouraged me to maintain open communication and update her regularly on my condition.

Throughout the week, my symptoms persisted, and I experienced difficulty breathing. Concerned about my respiratory health, I contacted my doctor again on October 22, 2021. Based on my worsening condition, she advised me to seek emergency medical attention. Consequently, I immediately went to the hospital where I received a thorough examination and was diagnosed with severe Covid-19 pneumonia.

During my hospitalization, which lasted for the next ten days, I was closely monitored and received oxygen therapy to aid my breathing. The medical team also administered antiviral medications and antibiotics to manage the infection and prevent any secondary complications.

Fortunately, my condition gradually improved, and I was discharged on November 2, 2021, with instructions to continue self-isolating at home and slowly resume my daily activities. Despite the physical and emotional toll of the infection, I remained resilient and determined to regain my strength.

After recovering from the initial infection, I actively followed news and scientific updates regarding Covid-19 vaccines. Recognizing the importance of vaccination in preventing future infections and contributing to the collective effort of ending the pandemic, I eagerly signed up for the vaccine as soon as it became available to me in early 2022. I received the recommended two doses of the vaccine, ensuring I did my part to protect myself and the community around me.

Throughout this challenging journey, I remained grateful for my health, independence, and the support of my loved ones. The experience deepened my appreciation for life and further fueled my commitment to creating innovative and sustainable building designs that positively impact society and the environment.
