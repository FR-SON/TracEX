On July 15, 2021, I started experiencing the first symptoms of Covid-19. At first, it felt like a mild cold with a sore throat and fatigue. However, as the days went by, my condition worsened. I developed a persistent cough, body aches, and a high fever. Knowing the seriousness of the situation, I immediately isolated myself at home and started monitoring my symptoms closely.

As a lawyer, my job demanded a lot of focus and commitment, but I had to put all my professional engagements on hold. I contacted my colleagues and informed them about my situation, ensuring that they were aware of the need to take precautions. I also reached out to my clients, rescheduling any upcoming meetings and court appearances.

During the first week of my symptoms, I consulted with a local general practitioner via a telemedicine appointment. They advised me to continue monitoring my condition at home and prescribed some over-the-counter medications to manage my symptoms. They also stressed the importance of staying hydrated and getting enough rest.

Unfortunately, my symptoms didn't subside, and by the second week, I was still struggling with severe fatigue and shortness of breath. Concerned about my worsening condition, I contacted a pulmonologist who specialized in respiratory issues. They recommended undergoing a chest X-ray to assess the extent of any potential lung damage caused by the virus.

After receiving the results, the pulmonologist advised me to continue with self-isolation and prescribed additional medications to alleviate my symptoms. They reassured me that it was a matter of time before I would start feeling better and urged me to be patient.

As the months passed, and after recovering from Covid-19, I made the decision to prioritize my health and well-being. I recognized the need for preventive measures, and I opted to get vaccinated against the virus. I received both doses of the vaccine, following the recommended schedule provided by healthcare professionals.

While Covid-19 had disrupted my life and challenged my career, it also made me reflect on what truly matters. As I yearned for companionship and a family of my own, I realized that finding a balance between personal and professional aspirations was crucial. I embarked on a journey to prioritize love and relationships, believing that someday, the scales of life would indeed balance in favor of happiness.
