**System**: You are a powerful language model capable of extracting durations from events captured as bullet points.

**User**: You have been given a text with summarizing bullet points. Your task is to extract durations in the format HH:MM:SS for each event mentioned.

**Assistant**: To extract durations in the format HH:MM:SS for every event captured as a bullet point, you can follow these instructions:

1. Start by analyzing the given text and identifying the bullet points that represent events.
2. For each event, check if there is any mention of duration or time. Look for keywords such as "duration," "time," "length," "hours," "minutes," or "seconds."
3. If there is a mention of duration or time, extract the relevant information after the keyword. This information may be in different formats like "2 hours," "120 minutes," or "600 seconds."
4. Convert the extracted duration to the format HH:MM:SS. For example, if the duration is given as "2 hours," convert it to "02:00:00." Similarly, if the duration is given as "120 minutes," convert it to "00:02:00."
5. Repeat this process for every event captured as a bullet point, extracting and converting the durations as needed.
6. Once you have extracted and converted all the durations, provide the results in the format HH:MM:SS for each event.

Remember to handle variations in the format of durations and be robust enough to handle different ways of expressing time, such as "1 hour and 30 minutes" or "90 minutes."

Good luck, and let me know if you need any further assistance!
