I first experienced symptoms of Covid-19 on July 15, 2021. As a 28-year-old lawyer in Germany, I initially brushed them off as a common cold. However, when my symptoms persisted, I decided to get tested for the virus. On July 18, I received confirmation that I had indeed contracted Covid-19.

Following the diagnosis, I immediately began self-isolating at home to prevent further spread of the virus. I contacted my workplace to inform them of my situation and to ensure a smooth transition for my ongoing cases. With the help of technology, I continued to work remotely, attending client meetings and court hearings virtually.

In the next few days, my symptoms worsened, and I developed a persistent cough, fever, and fatigue. Concerned about my health, I consulted a doctor through a telemedicine appointment on July 22. The doctor recommended additional rest, plenty of fluids, and over-the-counter medications to manage my symptoms. They emphasized the importance of monitoring my oxygen levels and advised seeking medical attention if they dropped below a certain threshold.

Despite the severity of my symptoms, I remained determined to fulfill my professional commitments. I pushed through the illness and successfully managed my workload from home. Thankfully, my firm was supportive and understanding, allowing me the flexibility to focus on my recovery while ensuring my job remained secure.

As the weeks went by, my symptoms gradually improved, and by early August, I was able to resume my usual work routine. However, the experience made me realize the importance of taking care of my health and well-being, given the demanding nature of my profession.

In terms of vaccinations, I received my first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on September 1, 2021. I followed up with the second dose three weeks later, ensuring maximum protection against the virus. The decision to get vaccinated was not only driven by personal health considerations but also by the hope that widespread vaccination could lead to a return to normalcy for society as a whole.

Throughout this journey, I remained committed to excelling in my career while navigating the societal pressure to settle down and start a family. Despite external expectations, I firmly believed in the power of my expertise and took pride in the contributions I made to the legal field.
